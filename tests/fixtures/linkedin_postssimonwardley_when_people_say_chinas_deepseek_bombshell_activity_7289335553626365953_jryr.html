      content='When people say "China&apos;s DeepSeek Bombshell" -  https://lnkd.in/eUnYsTvq what they really mean is China&apos;s obvious and well signalled move towards open source AI - https://lnkd.in/eJ9kQ-Dc - and this is only the beginning i.e. not there yet.

It is unfortunate the West continues to pursue a dual path of new theocracies under AI - https://lnkd.in/exJVmNvD - and the creation of Elysium. We had several opportunities to adapt and change course. 

I will admit to my own bias here, I&apos;ve never been keen on the idea of crypto bro feudal lords aka the rise of the petulant man child. Hence I&apos;m glad that China remains committed to common prosperity and the creation of that vision of a Star Trek Federation. In that sense I suppose it&apos;s useful that China&apos;s strategic gameplay far exceeds anything that Western business leaders can muster. 

It&apos;s never over though. France demonstrates some good cheer and strategic wit by continuing to push with Mistral AI. In the UK, in 2010, I was involved in trying to help Gov become more open, to adopt new ways of thinking - https://lnkd.in/e7-u8APN - and we had some small successes and that still continues today which is encouraging. Even in the gloom, there are always sparks of creativity and clear thinking such as the marvellous Boiling Frogs paper by GCHQ https://lnkd.in/e5P_fTYN.

It&apos;s never over because good people continue to fight the fight to make society a better place. Our future in the West doesn&apos;t have to be the super wealthy in Bugatti starships whilst the many live in abject poverty fighting over crumbs.

However, back to the subject of China. In 2015 when I presented my China vs USA research in Washington (the poorly named "Clash of the Titans" report), I explained how through a combination of techniques from understanding supply chains to gameplay to use of mixed economic models (see map below) that China would out-innovate and outpace the US across a huge range of industries. I argued that we needed to become more strategic, more open and focus on common prosperity. I was met with guffaws, dismissal and senior execs declaring that "Silicon Valley would out innovate China" - it was naked racism mixed with nationalistic viewpoints, hubris and an overdose of greed. I&apos;m not convinced much has changed in the last decade. It&apos;s a shame. 

The US has massive problems heading its way including the disaster that will become bitcoin - https://lnkd.in/egjPqd8b. The failure to adapt the "Washington" economic model to something more contextual will also not serve it well. 

This division will become blindingly obvious over the next decade with China leading the world not only in economic and technological landscapes but also in the social and political ones. This is not a "Trump" thing, this started long before him. He is a symptom not a cause nor a cure. Well, to be more accurate, I have no reason to believe he is a cure.

I do hope we adapt with grace in the West. Alas "grace" and "petulant man child" don&apos;t mix well. | 140 comments on LinkedIn'

At which point the US AI scene could be in real trouble.\n\nI'm fairly convinced that a lot of US based AI companies don't even know what training data they've actually used, it hasn't been recorded effectively. I know of one major system where that's the case. \n\nChina has already indicated it will use (and is building) blacklists for training data. If US companies can't provide provenance then they'll be out of the game. \n\nWhat are enterprises going to use? An AI system with unknown provenance in training data that pretends to be open source with claims of \"trust us\" or an actual open source AI which includes open source training data that you can see and even run yourself? \n\nThere is no open source AI without open source training data. Never was.\n\nPersonally, I will enjoy listening to the twisted arguments that OSI will try and come up with for its mangled definition of Open Source AI (OSAID) when China will be able to clearly say \"Open source should mean all the symbolic instructions are open sourced and that includes the training data\"",

        "articleBody": "When people say \"China's DeepSeek Bombshell\" -  https://lnkd.in/eUnYsTvq what they really mean is China's obvious and well signalled move towards open source AI - https://lnkd.in/eJ9kQ-Dc - and this is only the beginning i.e. not there yet.\n\nIt is unfortunate the West continues to pursue a dual path of new theocracies under AI - https://lnkd.in/exJVmNvD - and the creation of Elysium. We had several opportunities to adapt and change course. \n\nI will admit to my own bias here, I've never been keen on the idea of crypto bro feudal lords aka the rise of the petulant man child. Hence I'm glad that China remains committed to common prosperity and the creation of that vision of a Star Trek Federation. In that sense I suppose it's useful that China's strategic gameplay far exceeds anything that Western business leaders can muster. \n\nIt's never over though. France demonstrates some good cheer and strategic wit by continuing to push with Mistral AI. In the UK, in 2010, I was involved in trying to help Gov become more open, to adopt new ways of thinking - https://lnkd.in/e7-u8APN - and we had some small successes and that still continues today which is encouraging. Even in the gloom, there are always sparks of creativity and clear thinking such as the marvellous Boiling Frogs paper by GCHQ https://lnkd.in/e5P_fTYN.\n\nIt's never over because good people continue to fight the fight to make society a better place. Our future in the West doesn't have to be the super wealthy in Bugatti starships whilst the many live in abject poverty fighting over crumbs.\n\nHowever, back to the subject of China. In 2015 when I presented my China vs USA research in Washington (the poorly named \"Clash of the Titans\" report), I explained how through a combination of techniques from understanding supply chains to gameplay to use of mixed economic models (see map below) that China would out-innovate and outpace the US across a huge range of industries. I argued that we needed to become more strategic, more open and focus on common prosperity. I was met with guffaws, dismissal and senior execs declaring that \"Silicon Valley would out innovate China\" - it was naked racism mixed with nationalistic viewpoints, hubris and an overdose of greed. I'm not convinced much has changed in the last decade. It's a shame. \n\nThe US has massive problems heading its way including the disaster that will become bitcoin - https://lnkd.in/egjPqd8b. The failure to adapt the \"Washington\" economic model to something more contextual will also not serve it well. \n\nThis division will become blindingly obvious over the next decade with China leading the world not only in economic and technological landscapes but also in the social and political ones. This is not a \"Trump\" thing, this started long before him. He is a symptom not a cause nor a cure. Well, to be more accurate, I have no reason to believe he is a cure.\n\nI do hope we adapt with grace in the West. Alas \"grace\" and \"petulant man child\" don't mix well.",

                  - and this is only the beginning i.e. not there yet. It is
                  unfortunate the West continues to pursue a dual path of new
                  theocracies under AI -

                  - and the creation of Elysium. We had several opportunities to
                  adapt and change course. I will admit to my own bias here,
                  I've never been keen on the idea of crypto bro feudal lords
                  aka the rise of the petulant man child. Hence I'm glad that
                  China remains committed to common prosperity and the creation
                  of that vision of a Star Trek Federation. In that sense I
                  suppose it's useful that China's strategic gameplay far
                  exceeds anything that Western business leaders can muster.
                  It's never over though. France demonstrates some good cheer
                  and strategic wit by continuing to push with Mistral AI. In
                  the UK, in 2010, I was involved in trying to help Gov become
                  more open, to adopt new ways of thinking -

                  - and we had some small successes and that still continues
                  today which is encouraging. Even in the gloom, there are
                  always sparks of creativity and clear thinking such as the
                  marvellous Boiling Frogs paper by GCHQ

                  >. It's never over because good people continue to fight the
                  fight to make society a better place. Our future in the West
                  doesn't have to be the super wealthy in Bugatti starships
                  whilst the many live in abject poverty fighting over crumbs.
                  However, back to the subject of China. In 2015 when I
                  presented my China vs USA research in Washington (the poorly
                  named "Clash of the Titans" report), I explained how through a
                  combination of techniques from understanding supply chains to
                  gameplay to use of mixed economic models (see map below) that
                  China would out-innovate and outpace the US across a huge
                  range of industries. I argued that we needed to become more
                  strategic, more open and focus on common prosperity. I was met
                  with guffaws, dismissal and senior execs declaring that
                  "Silicon Valley would out innovate China" - it was naked
                  racism mixed with nationalistic viewpoints, hubris and an
                  overdose of greed. I'm not convinced much has changed in the
                  last decade. It's a shame. The US has massive problems heading
                  its way including the disaster that will become bitcoin -

                  >. The failure to adapt the "Washington" economic model to
                  something more contextual will also not serve it well. This
                  division will become blindingly obvious over the next decade
                  with China leading the world not only in economic and
                  technological landscapes but also in the social and political
                  ones. This is not a "Trump" thing, this started long before
                  him. He is a symptom not a cause nor a cure. Well, to be more
                  accurate, I have no reason to believe he is a cure. I do hope
                  we adapt with grace in the West. Alas "grace" and "petulant
                  man child" don't mix well.

                        What is happening is a well signalled move "towards"
                        open source AI, however it's not there yet. The real
                        payload happens when China open sources the training
                        data. At which point the US AI scene could be in real
                        trouble. I'm fairly convinced that a lot of US based AI
                        companies don't even know what training data they've
                        actually used, it hasn't been recorded effectively. I
                        know of one major system where that's the case. China
                        has already indicated it will use (and is building)
                        blacklists for training data. If US companies can't
                        provide provenance then they'll be out of the game. What
                        are enterprises going to use? An AI system with unknown
                        provenance in training data that pretends to be open
                        source with claims of "trust us" or an actual open
                        source AI which includes open source training data that
                        you can see and even run yourself? There is no open
                        source AI without open source training data. Never was.
                        Personally, I will enjoy listening to the twisted
                        arguments that OSI will try and come up with for its

                        A focus on common prosperity fits very well with what W.
                        Deming already said with his New Economics in the
                        80s/90s. He had shown on a national scale 3 times that
                        collaboration makes countries strong, not competition:
                        the US war effort in WWII, then Japan, and then the US
                        to some extent in the 80s/90s. Also fits very well with
                        TOC thinking. Greed, disdain and distrust regularly
                        wreck civilizations ... and it seems the western
                        emphasis on individual "winning" through making others
                        lose makes us very vulnerable to that trap.

                        I must admit my confirmation bias is skeptical of
                        Chinese motives. I had a friend who lived in HK who
                        would frequently share news coming out of HK and would
                        share regular CPP backed propaganda. I am incredibly
                        untrusting of technology they share with the West for
                        this reason. However willing to be challenged as we’re
                        witnessing the decline of some important Western Values
                        in the US and I’m equally rapidly becoming untrusting of
                        the Robber Baron and Welfare Queen oligarchy that
                        appears to be forming…

                        Those executives likely didn't see any personal benefits
                        to common prosperity, what's in it for them? It's so
                        strongly against their beliefs that there needs to be a
                        strong personal benefit for them to consider rethinking
                        those ideas that lead them to such personal wealth and
                        power. Thank you for sharing, it's good to think about,
                        these are sadly interesting times.

                        You seem to imply that the Chinese open source model
                        here is driven by core open source ethos. I see this as
                        nothing more than long-game economic warfare on the part
                        of the CCP. You see common prosperity. I see an
                        existential threat and they did this by using the fruits
                        of OpenAI's long-term investment.

                        Motivated/wishful thinking is clear here and even though
                        China has succeeded in research... it's a top down,
                        centralized economic decision-making regime that will
                        limit economic exploitation of whatever research
                        findings they publish. They can't dominate economically
                        with protected IP and they can't disrupt with open IP.
                        It's a lost cause.
