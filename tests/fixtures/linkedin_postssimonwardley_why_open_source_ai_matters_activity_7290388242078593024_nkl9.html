  <meta name="description" content="Back in 2023, I took a position (based upon a discussion at the beginning of the year at the State of Open Conference UK) that the world of open source AI was mostly open washing.

&quot;In our new world, the few have once again brought their proprietary ideas to the space but they’ve dressed themselves up as being open source because they open a subset of the symbolic instructions needed to create the system. I say subset because they don’t open, for example, training data which is also part of the symbolic instructions used to program the system.&quot; - https://lnkd.in/eJ9kQ-Dc

Since then, I've heard a horde of arguments on why the training data doesn't need to be open sourced from :
* privacy and the dangers of synthetic data.
* a future ability to reverse engineer the model to get to the training data.
* safety doesn't require it and guardrails are good enough.
* OSAID doesn't require it.
* future techniques (not yet invented) will solve the problem.
* training data is not part of the set of symbolic instructions.
* we need to compromise and can't be open source purists.
* the training data isn't useful
* if we required that then large tech companies wouldn't invest in the UK.

I've listened to the arguments and some of them have been very compelling &amp; very challenging but my position remains that there is no open source AI without open source training data. All the components need to be open. The OSAID should be dumped.

My interest in DeepSeek is not because it is an open source AI (it isn't) but because it's part of a signal from China towards more open source AI. This is part of a journey and it's a positive one in my book. | 12 comments on LinkedIn">

        " dir="ltr" data-test-id="main-feed-activity-card__commentary">Back in 2023, I took a position (based upon a discussion at the beginning of the year at the State of Open Conference UK) that the world of open source AI was mostly open washing.

"In our new world, the few have once again brought their proprietary ideas to the space but they’ve dressed themselves up as being open source because they open a subset of the symbolic instructions needed to create the system. I say subset because they don’t open, for example, training data which is also part of the symbolic instructions used to program the system." - <a class="link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Flnkd%2Ein%2FeJ9kQ-Dc&amp;urlhash=QnKG&amp;trk=public_post-text" target="_self" rel="nofollow" data-tracking-control-name="public_post-text" data-tracking-will-navigate>https://lnkd.in/eJ9kQ-Dc</a>

Since then, I've heard a horde of arguments on why the training data doesn't need to be open sourced from :
* privacy and the dangers of synthetic data.
* a future ability to reverse engineer the model to get to the training data.
* safety doesn't require it and guardrails are good enough.
* OSAID doesn't require it.
* future techniques (not yet invented) will solve the problem.
* training data is not part of the set of symbolic instructions.
* we need to compromise and can't be open source purists.
* the training data isn't useful
* if we required that then large tech companies wouldn't invest in the UK.

I've listened to the arguments and some of them have been very compelling &amp; very challenging but my position remains that there is no open source AI without open source training data. All the components need to be open. The OSAID should be dumped.

My interest in DeepSeek is not because it is an open source AI (it isn't) but because it's part of a signal from China towards more open source AI. This is part of a journey and it's a positive one in my book.</p>

Given the significant implications this equivalence has for AI safety and policy, placing this supporting research in the public domain would help others better understand your conclusions.</p>
