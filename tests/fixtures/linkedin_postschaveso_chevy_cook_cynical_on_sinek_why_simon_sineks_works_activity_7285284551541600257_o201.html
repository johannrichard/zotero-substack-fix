Sinek's simplifications are cognitively helpful, but as you articulate it's not the whole story. This is especially true when talking about organizations at the scale of the services. I'm reminded of March's On Leadership when talking basic blocking and tackling:\n\n\"These four things—competence, initiative, identification, and unobtrusive coordination—are very conventional. They are found in any standard book on administration. Because they are so conventional and so standard, many of us who think we are sophisticated sometimes act as through they are unimportant.\"\n\nFurther, I'm REALLY glad to see Skinner making a comeback in your piece as the masses realize just how complex organizational dynamics and power structures have become within our system. Mixed with March's work, Skinner reminds us that, especially at scale with high diversity in team composition and tasks, a 'why' is really an insufficient heuristic for military leaders.\n\nNevertheless, distillations like Sinek's (if we approach him more as an inspirational storyteller) are helpful for leaders to pay attention to from a methodological standpoint of effectively contextualizing and framing a conceptual starting point.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Nate Bump"},"interactionStatistic":{"@type":"InteractionCounter","interactionType":"http://schema.org/LikeAction","userInteractionCount":1}},{"@type":"Comment","datePublished":"2025-01-16T23:25:39.757Z","text":"Chaveso Cook, Ph.D. thanks for posting this and for writing a thought-provoking argument.

Another: Why do we value his anecdotes of other’s experiences without questioning or looking at his body of work?  What has he led? Where’s his body of research?

In this article, I call out some of the shortfalls of Sinek. I’m not saying that none of his thoughts have merit. I’m saying that he has a tendency to an oversimplify of a lot of complex topics, among other gaps in his perspectives.

Sinek's simplifications are cognitively helpful, but as you articulate it's not the whole story. This is especially true when talking about organizations at the scale of the services. I'm reminded of March's On Leadership when talking basic blocking and tackling:

"These four things—competence, initiative, identification, and unobtrusive coordination—are very conventional. They are found in any standard book on administration. Because they are so conventional and so standard, many of us who think we are sophisticated sometimes act as through they are unimportant."

Further, I'm REALLY glad to see Skinner making a comeback in your piece as the masses realize just how complex organizational dynamics and power structures have become within our system. Mixed with March's work, Skinner reminds us that, especially at scale with high diversity in team composition and tasks, a 'why' is really an insufficient heuristic for military leaders.

Nevertheless, distillations like Sinek's (if we approach him more as an inspirational storyteller) are helpful for leaders to pay attention to from a methodological standpoint of effectively contextualizing and framing a conceptual starting point.</p>

         comment__text babybear:mt-0.5" dir="ltr">What you've written here about the cognition that great leadership requires is more and more important for business and non-profit leaders as the pace of change continues to accelarate across technological possibility, government policy and information generation and availability. And also as we continue to recognize that the diverse backgrounds of the people we lead means they won't necessarily respond exactly the same way to leadership prompts.

While I may regard purpose as an anchoring principle of organizational leadership to which I consistently return to in order to ground myself and my people, effective leadership requires the ability to recognize which cognitive tool a situation calls for and to seamlessly pull it from my toolkit as the situation unfolds. Acquiring the tools isn't free; it requires humility as we learn, often through imitation. And becoming skilled with them is often not easy; it comes with practice. 

With the advent of AI, VUCA and the leadership challenges it presents will continue to thicken. Therefore effective leadership will require the agility, versatility and wisdom to switch between tools and use them masterfully. No single "leadership guru's" approach is expansive enough to guarantee success.</p>

         comment__text babybear:mt-0.5" dir="ltr">It’s always useful to critique the popular ideas our culture gloms onto. Simplifying the complex isn’t a logical reason to believe in the simplification- other than we humans like that. Maybe we even need it. But that doesn’t make it right.

The strongest argument I think you made was: “One of the most glaring critiques of Sinek’s work is the lack of empirical evidence supporting his claims. Data-driven leadership and performance metrics are essential in the military and other large organizational contexts. You don’t have to dig deep to see that his ideas are only built on anecdotes from well-known leaders. “

There are a lot of good critiques of case studies- and <a class="link" href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/dave-snowden-2a93b?trk=public_post_comment-text" target="_self" data-tracking-control-name="public_post_comment-text" data-tracking-will-navigate>Dave Snowden</a> isn’t the only one who points out their flaws. The main one is that they allow us to assign one causal variable to a complex set of effects- and sound “sciency”. It speaks to our weaknesses as humans: we like our simplified stories and we like when we can attribute effects to one thing. Makes thinking and life easier- at least proximately.

Paradoxically, if we followed Steve Jobs’ “why” in the military we’d embrace someone questioning the status quo. Instead we reject it. Maybe that goes to our real “why”: conformity…</p>

There was a senior leader (AF) client of my team’s in which my consultant leadership was surprised that he wasn’t a fan of Sinek.   I wasn’t surprised.   “Leaders Eat Last,” (learned that in cadet basic training), “start with why” (cadet field training and officer basic-it’s the commander’s intent).  I started one of those books but after a few pages in I was like, “this isn’t worth my time, this has already been drilled into me.”</p>

One LPD where the man himself even VTC-ed in for not a small fee to regurgitate platitudes at a quite literally captive audience. I am always suspicious of leaders that suggest Simon Sinek on their reading lists because it always struck me as intellectually lazy fodder where the leader is always the hero in the end because he followed these very simple steps that totally removed the human element from the equation.</p>

You read the book, you think now you know better, and then you go back to your environment and almost everything you thought would change your life, is inapplicable. Like Mike Tyson says: you have a plan until you feel the first punch in your face. </p>

I accept that Sinek shows in a simplified way some/quite a few things that are complex, but it has a merit and it is that for many high-level managers or immediately below, they realized that the meaning of a real purpose was and continues to be absolutely absent in many organizations. That is why it is so significant for many, and not because it has a conclusion based on science, it is something that is closely related to psychology, rather than hard science, we are talking about people's feelings facing a reality that is difficult to change in many organizations.</p>

We’re busy. That’s the default leadership complaint. Yet many of today’s greatest leaders coach not from time abundance, but from presence intention. Monique Valcour’s HBR essay challenges us: great coaching is not hours in a calendar block—it’s quality embedded in micro-moments.  

She argues that listening, pausing, and good questions deliver more long-term growth than long speeches or agenda-driven sessions. But beneath her wise advice lies an unspoken risk: without design, micro-coaching becomes coaching theater. The same system forces that killed deep feedback will corrode micro-coaching too, unless we rebuild incentives from the ground up.

Here’s how I’d embed coaching into real systems (Systemic Moral Design™ style):
	1.	Coaching defaults, not options. Use templates, queues, and triggers so leaders don’t have to invent coaching in each moment.
	2.	Evidence Escrow for coaching. Record context, prompts, and commitments for each conversation.
	3.	Measure density, not duration. Track impact per coaching minute rather than hours coached.
	4.	Decision-Age coaching triggers. If a challenge stutters or lingers beyond threshold, schedule a required coaching moment.
	5.	AI-assisted scaffolding. Use AI to suggest provocative questions or reflect transcripts—but leave judgment and humanity in human hands.
	6.	Protect coaching time. Build “coaching reserved slots” into leadership calendars, prioritized like performance reviews.

When leaders do this, coaching scales. It becomes part of culture, not a luxury. The paradox is: by embedding coaching structure, you free up headroom even when you’re busy.

Let’s stop asking “How can I coach more?” and ask “How do we make coaching the default?” Because in a world of constant disruption, development is no longer optional — it’s the only sustainable path.

Let’s face it: most managers are too busy to coach.
Deadlines, meetings, emails, fires to put out… and coaching often falls to the bottom of the list.
But here’s the hard truth: if you’re not coaching, you’re not leading.

In today’s AI-driven, high-speed workplace, your value as a leader isn’t in how much you know — it’s in how effectively you grow others.
And you don’t need an hour-long session to do it.
You just need to ask more questions, prompt people to think, and pause before you give answers.

🔑 What Great Managerial Coaches Do Differently

✅ They stay curious.
 When someone brings a problem, resist the urge to fix it. Ask:
“What options have you considered?”
 “What outcome are you hoping for?”
That one minute of curiosity builds ownership — not dependency.

✅ They create thinking space.
Leaders like Indra Nooyi and Satya Nadella made listening and reflection part of their culture. They didn’t jump in with solutions; they helped others find their own.

✅ They empower, not instruct.
 A coaching mindset encourages accountability — people start thinking for themselves instead of waiting for direction.

⚙️ The Result
You get teams that are more capable, confident, and creative — which drives performance and innovation.

Coaching isn’t a luxury. It’s a leadership discipline.

💬 So here’s the question:
 What’s one coaching question you’ll ask your team today instead of giving them the answer?
Let’s make leadership less about telling — and more about transforming.

And every time I do, I realize something powerful:   you can’t create your next level of success from your current identity (the “current you” trap).

Organizational psychologist Dr. Benjamin Hardy explains that your future self is a different person, with new priorities, skills, and ways of thinking.

Research from UCLA’s Hal Hershfield confirms it:  when we don’t see our future self as distinct, we default to short-term thinking that keeps us stuck in old ways.

Here’s what that can look like:
 - Aiming for the next role but leading from today’s comfort zone. 
- Preparing for future opportunities using today’s limitations as your guide.

In the “current you” trap, old unconscious patterns control you. Your past informs your present.

The shift? 
Start defining yourself in future leadership terms. 
What does the respected, influential version of you look like in action?
 Write it down and let your future inform your present. Lead from her today.

If you swipe through the carousel you’ll see graphics to better understand these concepts.

Here are a few takeaways from our panelists, <a class="link" href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/klaudia-gorczyca-46022150?trk=public_post-text" target="_self" data-tracking-control-name="public_post-text" data-tracking-will-navigate>Klaudia Gorczyca</a>, <a class="link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ralitzafortunova?trk=public_post-text" target="_self" data-tracking-control-name="public_post-text" data-tracking-will-navigate>Ralitza Fortunova</a>, <a class="link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaime-beckel?trk=public_post-text" target="_self" data-tracking-control-name="public_post-text" data-tracking-will-navigate>Jaime K. Beckel</a>, and <a class="link" href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/mariaaldous?trk=public_post-text" target="_self" data-tracking-control-name="public_post-text" data-tracking-will-navigate>Maria A.</a> that sparked real shifts:

✨ Preparation is power, but curiosity is a superpower.

✨ The most grounded negotiators know their values and boundaries before they walk into the room.

✨ Emotions are valid—but clarity is vital.

When we bring our full, authentic selves without letting emotions cloud the ask, we not only articulate our value, but we embody it.

So before your next big negotiation, remember:

🔹 What are your deal makers and deal breakers?

🔹 Are you listening for what they really need, not just what they say they want?

🔹 And most importantly, are you advocating from a place of peace within yourself?

I was discussing a collaboration with a company.
Sent documents. Sent a draft spreadsheet.
Asked to meet so we could co-build the plan together.

Then I get the call:
"We presented your proposal to the board. They voted no."
Wait. What?
"It was a draft. Nothing was validated. I wanted to meet to BUILD the plan together."
"Oh... we read it as your final version. That's why we rejected it."

What happened?

I assumed they'd see "DRAFT" and know it meant "let's discuss."
They assumed "DRAFT" was my finished proposal and decided without asking. 

Both sides made assumptions and both sides were wrong.

Here's what it reminded me of and how funny life is.

I teach this exact scenario in my negotiation classes:
→ Over-communicate intent. Even when it feels obvious.
 → Ask clarifying questions. Before making binding decisions.
 → Never assume the other side reads things the way you do.

What's an assumption that cost you something important?

They called him unprepared. They called him out of his depth. But by the end of the trial, Vinny Gambini taught a courtroom—and us—what real leadership looks like. It wasn't about a fancy suit or a polished resume.

It was about this:

1. Preparation is Your Greatest Weapon.

Vinny didn't have the experience, but he had something better: an obsessive focus on the details. "The two yutes..." scene wasn't just comedy; it was a lesson in cross-examination. He studied the case inside and out, turning his lack of formal training into a strength through sheer grit and homework. In business, there is no substitute for being the most prepared person in the room.

2. Embrace Your Unique Strengths

He was a loud, inexperienced lawyer from Brooklyn in a conservative Alabama courtroom. He stuck out. But he used his street smarts, his ability to connect with witnesses (like his fiancée, Mona Lisa Vito), and his relentless passion. He didn't try to be someone he wasn't. Authenticity, paired with competence, wins respect.

3. Adapt or Lose.
 
Remember when his car got crushed by a tractor-trailer? Or when he was held in contempt... repeatedly? Vinny faced setback after setback. But he adapted. He found a new car. He learned the judge's rules. He turned his exhaustion into a razor-sharp focus that won the case. Leadership isn't about avoiding failure; it's about how you pivot through it.

The verdict? 

True leadership isn't about your title. It's about your tenacity, your preparation, and the courage to be authentically, unapologetically you.

What's your favorite leadership lesson from an unexpected source?

We say it to ourselves before asking for the raise, the promotion, or the opportunity. But deserve is only half the story.
 The other half? Making it make sense — to the organization, the timing, and to you.

But asking for a seat at the table? That’s not just about a title—it’s about making sense.

In this piece, we explore how to:
 • Uncover what you actually bring to the table — beyond the buzzwords.
 • Define what you want, based on your season, not someone else’s checklist.
 • Separate fear from fact, so you can act—with clarity, not chaos.
 • Understand your market and your place within it.
 • Anchor your ask in mutual value—because it’s a win-win, not a plea.

This isn’t about asking for permission. It’s about clarity, leverage, and self-assessment.

Let’s talk about the difference between believing you deserve it and proving why it fits.
